To set the size of an interactive table you need input a size of a matrix, ex 4:4.
Pay attention:
  - no spaces are allowed 
  - the digits  are separated by colon ':'
  
After you press the button Start/Refresh it will create a table.
The 'click' event will be added to the table.
The main function which searches and matches the same icons is matchPic()
